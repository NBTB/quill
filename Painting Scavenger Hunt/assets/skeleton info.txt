In art, skeletons commonly act as the symbolic representative of death.  A skeleton is an easy way for an artist to indicate in any situation that it is likely something will either soon die, or has already recently died.  Death is a normal part of life and could potentially happen at any time normally; yet during a war, it is always lurking, and can happen anywhere.  To further indicate that the skeleton in the picture is indeed an indication of death, it is also draped in a shroud: an item often used to denote mourning, usually over someone’s death.
If you look closely to the bottom left of the skeleton, there is a scythe leaning next to the base of the parrott rifle the skeleton is standing behind.  Scythe’s are usually associated with death, often seen being carried by the Grim Reaper. 
The skeleton, representing death, is manning the parrott rifle, an instrument of war which is capable of bringing the same.  The skeleton acts as a final reminder that, although the rest of the scene may appear relatively peaceful, this is still a wartime setting, and death is still nearby.
