Many objects important to the painting are scattered acrossed the canvas.  You will know when you've found one because the object will become highlighted. Double Clicking on an object will open a description panel about the object, providing some background on the objects history and its relevance in the painting. It will then be sent to the objects menu where you can review this and other objects you have discovered.
