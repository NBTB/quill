A small fireplace.  Other than the moon, it is the only light source for the soldiers in this painting and is providing them warmth.  Most fire pits are built within holes in the ground. This  contains the fire to keep it from spreading, allowing the soldiers in the painting to safely sleep so close to it without having to worry about it catching them on fire.
