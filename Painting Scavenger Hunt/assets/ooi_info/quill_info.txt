Without modern communication techniques, it was much more difficult for people to remain in contact with each other during the Civil War.  Writing letters was the main form of communication between soldiers and their friends and loved ones back home.
Newer technologies such as photography and telegraphs had also begun to appear, but these were relatively rare, so the average soldier usually relied on letters while telegraphs were mainly reserved for military use.  The military of both the North and South preferred using telegraphs to communicate as it was both faster, and less likely to be intercepted than letters.
Physical letter writing is a rapidly  disappearing element of modern communication.  With so many ways to instantly contact persons the world over available to us, it is often difficult to understand what it would have been like during the Civil War, where a soldier could have waited weeks, or even months for a response from someone.
