As you can see, James Henry Beard put his signature in the bottom left corner of the picture, dated with the year 1865, the same year that the American Civil War ended.  The Night Before The Battle was then exhibited in May of that year at the National Academy of Design, just weeks after the end of the Civil War and assassination of President Lincoln.  It is significant that the painting was completed so close to the actual war it is depicting because the scene it captures looks so much more authentic.  The shocking truth of the war was captured with accurate military details.
