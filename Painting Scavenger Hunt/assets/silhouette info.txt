The silhouette of a sentry, stationed to keep watch in the darkness of the night.  It is representative of the fact that, during a war, someone was always keeping watch, even while everyone else was asleep.  There is no point during a conflict at which one can be completely sure of their safety, so even during the middle of the night, sentries kept watch to warn of an unexpected attack.
The sentry can be viewed symbolically to fill the role of the ‘guardian angel’, a conceptual figure watching over the soldiers from above to protect them during the time of conflict.  With this protective figure watching over them while they rest, the soldiers feel they are safe enough to be able to relax some and get some much needed sleep, for a short time free from the worries of the upcoming or past battles.
