Forms of entertainment to help keep soldiers awake of occupied while not in a battle, or involved in some other military-dictated activity, were a necessity to help keep them from stressing themselves out over upcoming battles.  Playing cards are suggestive of chance and luck, which could help a soldier survive during battle.  Gambling, either with cards or with other items, was a very common pastime for that reason.
Numerous other forms of entertainment were commonly used including reading (either newspapers or books) and sports (such as wrestling, baseball, or having races).  The two sides were known to compete against each other during long standoffs, where battle would temporarily come to a halt.
