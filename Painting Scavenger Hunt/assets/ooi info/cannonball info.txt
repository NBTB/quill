Metal is melted down, poured into a spherical mold, then cooled to create a surprisingly simple, yet terrifying deadly ammunition.  Cannons, and the cannonballs they fired, took a while to reload and were not terribly accurate weapons, so in the modern day have been replaced by much more efficient defensive emplacements.  However, when they did hit a target, the damage they could cause was just as real as that any modern weapon can produce (even if not on quite as grand a scale).
