A muzzle loaded gun fired from the shoulder: muskets were designed specifically for use by infantry. Muskets were the most commonly held weapon by soldiers in the civil war, on both the Union and Confederate sides.  While rifles were more accurate in firing, the barrels were much shorter than that of a musket.  A common military tactic was firing in ranks, but having the shorter barrel had the resulting risk of back ranks accidentally shooting the ranks in front of them.  Bayonet fighting was quite common, so having longer guns proved to be more effective.
