Gabions are wicker-like forms filled with stones and sandbags.  As seen in the image, there are lots of sandbags visible on the fortification.  Gabions acted as a defense for the soldiers.  Thick gabions could absorb the shock of most ammunition, including heavier grenades.  They were often positioned around Parrott Rifles, like in the painting, because they could form an effective wall, protecting the soldiers firing from enemy attacks.  They also are useful for building safe sleeping areas for the soldiers.  
Today, gabions are commonly used in civil engineering, as they are very effective in stabilizing shorelines and slopes against erosion. They also work well at redirecting water from floods or working as temporary dams.
