The flag indicates that  the men in the painting are union soldiers. It is draped over the soldier and is somewhat reminiscent of a cross.  Flags symbolize the concept of patriotism, and exist as a banners for men to rally to for confidence.  The soldier grips the flag tightly, as he is protective of it, and the patriotic message which it embodies.
Throughout the war, the flags of both sides changed a number of times, due to changing territories, ideologies, and political states.  The Union flag at the start of the war had 33 stars, each representing a state (the same way the current flag of the USA has 50 stars).  Soon after, the number increased to 34 with the addition of Kansas. Halfway through the war, it changed again when West Virginia split from the rest of Virginia to join, bringing the total to 35 stars.
