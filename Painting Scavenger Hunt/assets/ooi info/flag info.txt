The flag of the United States of America is draped across a sleeping sergeant in the Union army. Throughout the war, the flags for both sides changed multiple times.  At the start of the war, the Union flag had 33 stars, representing the 33 states originally committed to the Union. Over the course of the war, the number increased first to 34 stars with the addition of Kansas, and then to 35 when West Virginia seceded from the rest of Virginia.
