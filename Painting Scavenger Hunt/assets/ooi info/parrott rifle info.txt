A gun often used by soldiers during the civil war, they came in a number of different sizes and strengths. The parrott rifles in the painting resemble the ones which weighed 16.5k pounds, and fired shots weighing either 150 or 200 pounds a piece.
The weapon was first developed near the start of the war at the West Point Foundry in New York, and was quickly implemented as a defensive measure in Northern fortifications.  By the end of the war, however, both sides used the weapon commonly.  Also visible in the painting is the remains of another parrott rifle, referencing the fact that parrott rifles were known to break under heavy use.
