The Parrott rifle was developed in the North close to the start of the Civil War. By the war’s end, they were used by both the Union and Confederate armies. There are two working Parrott rifles in this painting, and a third which is damaged. The sergeant in the foreground on the lower right of the painting is using a damaged Parrott rifle as a backrest.
