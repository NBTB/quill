The flag bearer is a sergeant. You can see this by the red chevron insignia on his left arm and the red piping on his uniform.  Sergeants helped guide troop movement and kept the men in their positions by force of command.  The other sleeping soldiers are privates.  The privates were the lowest ranking military men, and did the majority of the fighting in the civil war.  Union soldiers displayed rank by the insignia on their soldiers.  In dress occasions, they wore the insignia on their epaulettes, and other occasions they wore them on their shoulder boards.  Different colors meant different ranks.
